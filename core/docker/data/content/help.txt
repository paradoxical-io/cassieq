Welcome to CassieQ!  This docker image contains several modes of execution to help you configure and run CassieQ.

1. bootstrap.  This mode populates (and upgrades) a cassandra keyspace to be useable with cassieq. It takes the following environment variables:

KEYSPACE='cassandra keyspace to use for cassieq'
CONTACT_POINTS='contact point'
USERNAME=''
PASSWORD=''

2. help. This menu

3. debug.  Debug starts in an empty shell and lets you bypass normal startup mode

4. config.  This prints out the CassieQ default config (with your normal CassieQ environemnt variables applied)
in order for you to create a customized config file to place in a virtual mount at /data/conf
